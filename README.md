# Towers Of Hanoi
Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle, that can be solved by using Python code alongside the Stack class. When coding this puzzle, I opted to program both possible options, as listed below.

## 1. Iterative
Iterative Towers of Hanoi is the more basic version, using purely function comparisons to calculate the final towers.

## 2. Recursive
Recursive Towers of Hanoi is a bit more complex, but in favour of efficiency. The program uses recursion by calling the function within itself to allow for a more efficient result when solving for the puzzle.
